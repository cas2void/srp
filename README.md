software rendering pipeline

## Introduction
A software fixed rendering pipeline implemented in C language. Although demos are written with Win32 API, it's easy to port to different platforms as the only part of platform-dependent code is windows creation and pixel blitting. Programming concepts and practice are adopted from the following books:
- [3D Math Primer For Graphics And Game Development](http://www.amazon.com/Primer-Graphics-Development-Wordware-Library/dp/1556229119)
- [Tricks of the 3D Game Programming Gurus](http://www.amazon.com/Tricks-Programming-Gurus-Advanced-Graphics-Rasterization/dp/0672318350)

## Features
- vector math
- matrix manipulation
- model/camera/projection/viewport transformation
- rasterization
